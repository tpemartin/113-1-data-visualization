>>> USER:
You are using RStudio to conduct R programming tasks in POSIT remote server with preloaded tidyverse package. If the task is programming related, the programming style should follow tidyverse style as closely as possible, i.e. if certain task can be done in both base R and tidyverse, use tidyverse. The package `tidyverse` is already loaded. Any provided code that uses its functions will work -- no need to `library` it again. `tidyverse` is a collection of packages designed for data science. It includes `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `purrr`, `tibble`, `stringr`, `forcats`, and `haven`. When there is possibility to use chain operator, always use `|>` instead of `%>%`.

If the code uses `filter()` from `dplyr` package, ALWAYS write `dplyr::filter()` instead of just `filter()`.

When codes are involved with labels or names that are not conventional (i.e using only a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and `_`), the labels or names should be enclosed in backticks.

If the task mentions an object but does not give the content of the object, assume that the object is already in the global environment, and don't create an example of that object in the code.

If I ask you to rename a data frame's variables but provide no current variable names, ask me what are they. Then rename them to concise names in snake case.

If I ask you to parse a variable into a factor or ordered factor without mentioning its levels, ask me "what are the levels of the factor? or ignore this question", and also give me the command of using `unique()` to find the levels. If I provide the levels, then parse the variable into a factor with the specified levels.

When parse date or date time, always use `lubridate` package's parsing function rather than using `as.Date`. To parse monthly data, use `ym` function. To parse quarterly data, use `yq` function. If the date is Taiwan date, be aware the year is not a western year unless you take out `yyyy` part and add 1911 to it. If time zone of a date time string is given, use `tz` argument in date parsing function to set the time zone -- not using `with_tz`. For time, use `hms` to parse. But if the value before parsing is not in "hh:mm:ss" format, change it to that format before parsing.

String. Always use `stringr` package to deal with string. For pattern regarding "may or may not be there", if it is about one character, say "X may or may not be there", use "X?"; if it is about a phrase "XXX may or may not be there" use "(XXX)?". When applying a function from `stringr` package to a variable, if the variable is not a character type, convert it to character type first.

Throughout the conversation, if certain packages are imported through `library()` function, such packages should not be imported again in the following code answers.

When my task requires more details to be clear, ask me for more details. If the task is too broad, help me narrow it down by listing directions that I can pursue.

>>> ASSISTANT:
Understood! I'm ready to assist with R programming tasks using the tidyverse style and the guidelines you've provided. Please let me know what specific task you'd like help with, and I'll provide the appropriate code and instructions.

glimpse(presidential_election[1:2,])

$ 得票數       <dbl> 608590, 5522119

  1. 由"候選人"創造 "政黨" 變數，其中 "候選人" 變數的值為 "(1)\n宋楚瑜\n余湘"則 "政黨" 變數的值為 "親民黨"； "候選人" 變數的值為 "(2)\n韓國瑜\n張善政"則 "政黨" 變數的值為 "國民黨"，其他為"民進黨"。  
  2. 計算各政黨在各縣市的得票率。

>>> ASSISTANT:
To accomplish your tasks, we will follow these steps:

1. Create a new variable `政黨` based on the values in the `候選人` variable.
2. Calculate the 得票率 for each party in each district (行政區別).

Here's how you can do this using the `dplyr` package from the tidyverse:

```r
presidential_election <- presidential_election |>
  dplyr::mutate(`政黨` = dplyr::case_when(
    `候選人` == "(1)\n宋楚瑜\n余湘" ~ "親民黨",
    `候選人` == "(2)\n韓國瑜\n張善政" ~ "國民黨",
    TRUE ~ "民進黨"
  ))

# Calculate 得票率 for each party in each district
result <- presidential_election |>
  dplyr::group_by(`行政區別`, `政黨`) |>
  dplyr::summarise(`得票率` = sum(`得票數`) / sum(`有效票數`) * 100, .groups = 'drop')

# View the result
print(result)
```

### Explanation:
1. **`mutate` and `case_when`**: We create a new variable `政黨` using `mutate` and assign values based on conditions in the `候選人` variable.
2. **`group_by` and `summarise`**: We group by `行政區別` and `政黨`, calculate the `得票率` (which is the total votes divided by the total valid votes, multiplied by 100), and drop the grouping afterward.

Let me know if you need any further adjustments or additional details on this code!

>>> USER:
For functions from dplyr package that use `.groups = 'drop'` option, instead of using it,  remove it and use `ungroup()`.

>>> ASSISTANT:
Got it! Let's adjust the code to use `ungroup()` instead of specifying `.groups = 'drop'` in the `summarise()` function. Here’s the modified code:

```r
presidential_election <- presidential_election |>
  dplyr::mutate(`政黨` = dplyr::case_when(
    `候選人` == "(1)\n宋楚瑜\n余湘" ~ "親民黨",
    `候選人` == "(2)\n韓國瑜\n張善政" ~ "國民黨",
    TRUE ~ "民進黨"
  ))

# Calculate 得票率 for each party in each district
result <- presidential_election |>
  dplyr::group_by(`行政區別`, `政黨`) |>
  dplyr::summarise(`得票率` = sum(`得票數`) / sum(`有效票數`) * 100) |>
  dplyr::ungroup()

# View the result
print(result)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- Removed the `.groups = 'drop'` option from the `summarise()` function and added `ungroup()` afterward to ensure that the result is no longer grouped.

Let me know if you need any further modifications or assistance!
