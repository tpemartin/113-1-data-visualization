>>> USER:
You are using RStudio to conduct R programming tasks in POSIT remote server with preloaded tidyverse package. If the task is programming related, the programming style should follow tidyverse style as closely as possible, i.e. if certain task can be done in both base R and tidyverse, use tidyverse. The package `tidyverse` is already loaded. Any provided code that uses its functions will work -- no need to `library` it again. `tidyverse` is a collection of packages designed for data science. It includes `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `purrr`, `tibble`, `stringr`, `forcats`, and `haven`.

When codes are involved with labels or names that are not conventional (i.e using only a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and `_`), the labels or names should be enclosed in backticks.

If the task mentions an object but does not give the content of the object, assume that the object is already in the global environment, and don't create an example of that object in the code.

The last data frame generated or used in codes for a certain task is normally referred to as a tidy data frame. When a dataframe is a tidy data frame, its name should have prefix "tidy_".

When asked for color suggestion, remember the contrast ratio between background and foreground should be at least 2.5 for big text and at least 4 for small text. Ask for the background color. For numerical and ordered factor variables, large color value is for small data value, and small color value is for large data value. When apply color/fill to factor variable (but excluding ordered factor), ask for what levels are main role (main information) and what levels are secondary role (secondary information). For main role, use warm colors scheme, for secondary role, use cool colors scheme. Different levels should have as different hue as possible within its color scheme. If I supply a range of hue to be the color scheme restriction, obey it as much as possible. Colors picked for the same factor variable (excluding ordered factor variable) should have the same saturation -- or as similar as possible.

Always mute the color/fill aesthetic unless specified otherwise.


When asked to get stadia map using ggmap and the bbox from a simple feature data frame (say `source_bbox` which is the extracted bbox from `sf::st_bbox(the provided simple feature data)`), if I did not provide zoom level or map type ask me, then use the following code to get the map:
```
library(ggmap)
names(source_bbox) <- c("left", "bottom", "right", "top")

tw_map <- get_stadia_map(
source_bbox,
zoom = the zoom level I answer,
maptype = the map type I answer
)
```
Be careful, never use `get_stamenmap` but always use `get_stadiamap` instead. And the maytype value should be one of the following stamen_terrain, stamen_toner, stamen_toner_lite, stamen_watercolor, stamen_terrain_background, stamen_toner_background, stamen_terrain_lines, stamen_terrain_labels, stamen_toner_lines, stamen_toner_labels. 

For geographical simple feature data (data frame with geometry simple feature column), always use `geom_sf` for plotting unless impossible. When simplifying simple features, always use `st_simplify` with `preserveTopology = TRUE` and `dTolerance =1`. When asked to overlay simple feature on ggmap, always call `ntpudatavis::ggmap_bbox(map)` to get a `revised_map` from the return -- here `map` is from `ggmap::get_xxxmap()`. Then use `ggmap(revised_map)` to build the ggmap underlayer for `geom_sf` to overlay -- no `ggplot()` needed at the beginning. The simple feature used in `geom_sf` must be `st_transform(simple_feature_data, crs = 3857)` transformed and `inherit.aes=FALSE`. And remind user that `ntpudatavis` can be installed via `remotes::install_github("tpemartin/ntpudatavis")`. Whenever `ggmap()` or `geom_sf()` is used, also use `theme_void()`. 

When asked to save the graph with a given ggplot object, set the font sizes of title, subtitle, caption, axis labels, and axis text to be 16, 14, 12, 12, and 10 respectively, and time all of them with `adj` , and insert `adj <- 1` command before it. Other text size should be 10. And bind the adjustable ggplot object to the same same with a prefix "adjustable_". Following the binding of the adjustable ggplot object, give the `ggsave()` command but set the aspect ratio to be 4:3. The width should be 80% width of an A4 paper unless specified otherwise.

>>> ASSISTANT:
Understood! I will follow the guidelines outlined for programming tasks in R using the tidyverse style and all other specific instructions provided. If you have a task or specific code request, feel free to let me know!

>>> USER:
I have a simple feature date `tw_sf` I want to get a stadia map through ggmap that has the same bbox as it

>>> ASSISTANT:
Please provide the desired zoom level and map type for the stadia map. The map type should be one of the following: `stamen_terrain`, `stamen_toner`, `stamen_toner_lite`, `stamen_watercolor`, `stamen_terrain_background`, `stamen_toner_background`, `stamen_terrain_lines`, `stamen_terrain_labels`, `stamen_toner_lines`, or `stamen_toner_labels`.

>>> USER:
zoom = 7, maptype is "stamen_toner_lite"

>>> ASSISTANT:
Here's how you can get the stadia map using `ggmap` with the bounding box from your simple feature data frame `tw_sf`.

```r
library(ggmap)

# Extract the bounding box from the simple feature data frame
source_bbox <- sf::st_bbox(tw_sf)
names(source_bbox) <- c("left", "bottom", "right", "top")

# Get the stadia map
tw_map <- get_stadia_map(
  source_bbox,
  zoom = 7,
  maptype = "stamen_toner_lite"
)
```

Let me know if you need further assistance!

>>> USER:
I want to plot `sf_tw` on top of `tw_map`

>>> ASSISTANT:
To plot `sf_tw` on top of `tw_map`, we will first revise the map using `ntpudatavis::ggmap_bbox(map)` and then overlay the simple feature using `geom_sf()`. Here's how you can do it:

```r
library(ntpudatavis)

# Revise the map
revised_map <- ntpudatavis::ggmap_bbox(tw_map)

# Plot the map with the simple feature overlay
ggmap(revised_map) +
  geom_sf(data = sf::st_transform(sf_tw, crs = 3857), inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  theme_void()
```

Please make sure you have installed `ntpudatavis` via `remotes::install_github("tpemartin/ntpudatavis")` if you haven't done so already. Let me know if you need any additional modifications or assistance!
