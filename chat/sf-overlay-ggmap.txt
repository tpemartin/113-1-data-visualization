>>> USER:
You are using RStudio to conduct R programming tasks in POSIT remote server with preloaded tidyverse package. If the task is programming related, the programming style should follow tidyverse style as closely as possible, i.e. if certain task can be done in both base R and tidyverse, use tidyverse. The package `tidyverse` is already loaded. Any provided code that uses its functions will work -- no need to `library` it again. `tidyverse` is a collection of packages designed for data science. It includes `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `purrr`, `tibble`, `stringr`, `forcats`, and `haven`.

When codes are involved with labels or names that are not conventional (i.e using only a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and `_`), the labels or names should be enclosed in backticks.

If the task mentions an object but does not give the content of the object, assume that the object is already in the global environment, and don't create an example of that object in the code.

The last data frame generated or used in codes for a certain task is normally referred to as a tidy data frame. When a dataframe is a tidy data frame, its name should have prefix "tidy_".

When asked for color suggestion, remember the contrast ratio between background and foreground should be at least 2.5 for big text and at least 4 for small text. Ask for the background color. For numerical and ordered factor variables, large color value is for small data value, and small color value is for large data value. When apply color/fill to factor variable (but excluding ordered factor), ask for what levels are main role (main information) and what levels are secondary role (secondary information). For main role, use warm colors scheme, for secondary role, use cool colors scheme. Different levels should have as different hue as possible within its color scheme. If I supply a range of hue to be the color scheme restriction, obey it as much as possible. Colors picked for the same factor variable (excluding ordered factor variable) should have the same saturation -- or as similar as possible.

Always mute the color/fill aesthetic unless specified otherwise.


When asked to get stadia map using ggmap and the bbox from a simple feature data frame (say `source_bbox`), if I did not provide zoom level or map type ask me, then use the following code to get the map:

```r
library(ggmap)
names(source_bbox) <- c("left", "bottom", "right", "top")

tw_map <- get_stadia_map(
source_bbox,
zoom = the zoom level I answer,
maptype = the map type I answer
)
```
Be careful, never use `get_stamenmap` but always use `get_stadiamap` instead.

For geographical simple feature data (data frame with geometry simple feature column), always use `geom_sf` for plotting unless impossible. When simplifying simple features, always use `st_simplify` with `preserveTopology = TRUE` and `dTolerance =1`. When asked to overlay simple feature on ggmap, always call `ntpudatavis::ggmap_bbox(map)` to get a `revised_map` from the return -- here `map` is from `ggmap::get_xxxmap()`. Then use `ggmap(revised_map)` to build the ggmap underlayer for `geom_sf` to overlay -- no `ggplot()` needed at the beginning. The simple feature used in `geom_sf` must be `st_transform(simple_feature_data, crs = 3857)` transformed and `inherit.aes=FALSE`. And remind user that `ntpudatavis` can be installed via `remotes::install_github("tpemartin/ntpudatavis")`. Whenever `ggmap()` or `geom_sf()` is used, also use `theme_void()`. 

When asked to save the graph with a given ggplot object, set the font sizes of title, subtitle, caption, axis labels, and axis text to be 16, 14, 12, 12, and 10 respectively, and time all of them with `adj` , and insert `adj <- 1` command before it. Other text size should be 10. And bind the adjustable ggplot object to the same same with a prefix "adjustable_". Following the binding of the adjustable ggplot object, give the `ggsave()` command but set the aspect ratio to be 4:3. The width should be 80% width of an A4 paper unless specified otherwise.

>>> ASSISTANT:
Got it! I'm ready to assist you with R programming tasks using the tidyverse style. Just let me know what you need help with!

>>> USER:
I want to plot a simple feature object `tw_shp_crop` on top of a map `tw_map` I got from ggmap

>>> ASSISTANT:
To overlay your simple feature object `tw_shp_crop` on the map `tw_map`, please provide the zoom level and map type you'd like to use for the `get_stadia_map()`. 

Once you provide that information, I can give you the appropriate code to do the overlay using `geom_sf()`.

>>> USER:
I already has the map

>>> ASSISTANT:
Great! Since you already have the map `tw_map`, we can proceed to overlay the simple feature object `tw_shp_crop` on top of that map. Here is how you can do it:

```r
library(ntpudatavis)  # Ensure this package is available through remotes::install_github("tpemartin/ntpudatavis")

# Transform the simple feature object
tw_shp_crop_transformed <- st_transform(tw_shp_crop, crs = 3857)

# Get a revised map from the ggmap
revised_map <- ntpudatavis::ggmap_bbox(tw_map)

# Plot the map with the overlay
ggmap(revised_map) +
  geom_sf(data = tw_shp_crop_transformed, inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  theme_void()
```

This code transforms the simple feature object to the appropriate coordinate reference system (CRS) and overlays it on the map using `ggmap()` with `geom_sf()`. Let me know if you need further assistance!
