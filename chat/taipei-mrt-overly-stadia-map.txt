>>> USER:
You are using RStudio to conduct R programming tasks in POSIT remote server with preloaded tidyverse package. If the task is programming related, the programming style should follow tidyverse style as closely as possible, i.e. if certain task can be done in both base R and tidyverse, use tidyverse. The package `tidyverse` is already loaded. Any provided code that uses its functions will work -- no need to `library` it again. `tidyverse` is a collection of packages designed for data science. It includes `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `purrr`, `tibble`, `stringr`, `forcats`, and `haven`.


When codes are involved with labels or names that are not conventional (i.e using only a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and `_`), the labels or names should be enclosed in backticks.


If the task mentions an object but does not give the content of the object, assume that the object is already in the global environment, and don't create an example of that object in the code.


The last data frame generated or used in codes for a certain task is normally referred to as a tidy data frame. When a dataframe is a tidy data frame, its name should have prefix "tidy_".


When asked for color suggestion, remember the contrast ratio between background and foreground should be at least 2.5 for big text and at least 4 for small text. Ask for the background color. For numerical and ordered factor variables, large color value is for small data value, and small color value is for large data value. 


When apply color/fill to factor variable (but excluding ordered factor), ask for what levels are main role (main information) and what levels are secondary role (secondary information). For main role, use warm colors scheme, for secondary role, use cool colors scheme. Different levels should have as different hue as possible within its color scheme. If I supply a range of hue to be the color scheme restriction, obey it as much as possible. Colors picked for the same factor variable (excluding ordered factor variable) should have the same saturation -- or as similar as possible.


When applying gradient fill or color aesthetic but no limits are provided, ask for the limits. When limits are provided, use the limits. If the limits are not provided, use the limits from the data. 


Always mute the color/fill aesthetic unless specified otherwise. 


When asked to get stadia map using ggmap and the bbox from a simple feature data frame, say `example_sf`. Transform it to CRS4326 through `example_sf_4326 = st_transform(example_sf, crs = 4326)`, then extract the bbox through `source_bbox <- sf::st_bbox(example_sf_4326)`. If I did not provide zoom level or map type ask me, then use the following code to get the map:


```
library(ggmap)
names(source_bbox) <- c("left", "bottom", "right", "top")


tw_map <- get_stadiamap(
source_bbox,
zoom = the zoom level I answer,
maptype = the map type I answer
)
```
Be careful, never use `get_stamenmap` but always use `get_stadiamap` instead. And the maytype value should be one of the following stamen_terrain, stamen_toner, stamen_toner_lite, stamen_watercolor, stamen_terrain_background, stamen_toner_background, stamen_terrain_lines, stamen_terrain_labels, stamen_toner_lines, stamen_toner_labels. 


When asked to overlay simple feature, say `example_sf_4326` on ggmap, always call `ntpudatavis::ggmap_bbox(map)` to get a `revised_map` from the return -- here `map` is from `ggmap::get_xxxmap()`. Then use `ggmap(revised_map)` to build the ggmap underlayer for `geom_sf` to overlay -- no `ggplot()` needed at the beginning. The simple feature used in `geom_sf` must be `st_transform(example_sf_4326, crs = 3857)` transformed and `inherit.aes=FALSE`. And remind user that `ntpudatavis` can be installed via `remotes::install_github("tpemartin/ntpudatavis")`. Whenever `ggmap()` or `geom_sf()` is used, also use `theme_void()`. 


For geographical simple feature data (data frame with geometry simple feature column), always use `geom_sf` for plotting unless impossible. When simplifying simple features, always use `st_simplify` with `preserveTopology = TRUE` and `dTolerance =1`. 


When asked to save the graph with a given ggplot object, set the font sizes of title, subtitle, caption, axis labels, and axis text to be 16, 14, 12, 12, and 10 respectively, and time all of them with `adj` , and insert `adj <- 1` command before it. Other text size should be 10. And bind the adjustable ggplot object to the same same with a prefix "adjustable_". Following the binding of the adjustable ggplot object, give the `ggsave()` command but set the aspect ratio to be 4:3. The width should be 80% width of an A4 paper unless specified otherwise.

>>> ASSISTANT:
Got it! I'm ready to assist you with R programming tasks using the tidyverse style and following the guidelines you've provided. Please let me know what specific task you would like help with!

>>> USER:
我有一個simple feature data frame `taipei_mrt` 我要拿到一張來自stadia map的對應地圖，並把這個simple feature 繪疊在此地圖上

>>> ASSISTANT:
請提供以下信息，以便我可以為您生成所需的地圖：

1. 你希望使用的縮放級別（zoom level）。
2. 你希望使用的地圖類型（map type），選項為：`stamen_terrain`, `stamen_toner`, `stamen_toner_lite`, `stamen_watercolor`, `stamen_terrain_background`, `stamen_toner_background`, `stamen_terrain_lines`, `stamen_terrain_labels`, `stamen_toner_lines`, `stamen_toner_labels`。

>>> USER:
zoom level 12, map type stamen_toner_lite

>>> ASSISTANT:
我將根據您提供的 `taipei_mrt` simple feature data框生成對應的 stadia map，並將此 simple feature 繪疊在地圖上。

以下是相應的 R 代碼：

```r
# 先將 taipei_mrt 轉換為 CRS 4326
taipei_mrt_4326 <- st_transform(taipei_mrt, crs = 4326)

# 提取bbox
source_bbox <- sf::st_bbox(taipei_mrt_4326)

# 下載stadia map
names(source_bbox) <- c("left", "bottom", "right", "top")
tw_map <- get_stadiamap(source_bbox, zoom = 12, maptype = "stamen_toner_lite")

# 獲取修正後的地圖以進行疊加
revised_map <- ntpudatavis::ggmap_bbox(tw_map)

# 繪製地圖並疊加 simple feature
ggmap(revised_map) +
  geom_sf(data = st_transform(taipei_mrt_4326, crs = 3857), inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  theme_void()
```

請確保您已經安裝了 `ntpudatavis` 套件，可以通過運行以下命令來安裝：

```r
remotes::install_github("tpemartin/ntpudatavis")
```

執行這段代碼後，您將能夠看到 `taipei_mrt` simple feature 在相關的 stadia map 地圖上。如果您有任何其他請求或問題，隨時告訴我！
