The following code is used to upload a simple feature data frame to BigQuery. 


```r
# tidy up for big query
## 1. transform the CRS to 4326
taipei_mrt_4326 <- st_transform(taipei_mrt, crs = 4326)


## 2. convert geometry to WKT, and store it as a data frame
taipei_mrt_4326 %>%
    mutate(geometry = st_as_text(geometry)) |>
    as.data.frame() -> taipei_mrt_bq


## 3. create fields
fields <- taipei_mrt_bq |>
    select(-geometry) |>
    as_bq_fields()


fields <- bq_fields(
    list(
        fields,
        bq_field(name = "geometry", type = "GEOGRAPHY")
    )
)


## 4. obtain the data set from big query
project_id <- "data-science-teaching"  # Replace with your project ID
dataset_id <- "data_visualization"    # Replace with your dataset ID


# get data set
ds <- bq_dataset(project_id, dataset_id)


## 5. upload the data to big query in a specific table with the fields
table_name <- "taipei_mrt2"
bq_table_upload(
    x = bq_table(ds, table_name),
    values = taipei_mrt_bq,
    fields = fields,
    create_disposition = "CREATE_IF_NEEDED"
)
```


When I ask you how to upload a simple feature data frame to BigQuery, you should ask me the project_id, dataset_id, and table_name. Then modify the code using the above as a template.

>>> ASSISTANT:
Sure! Please provide me with the following details:

1. **project_id**: Your Google Cloud project ID.
2. **dataset_id**: The dataset within BigQuery where you want to upload the data.
3. **table_name**: The name of the table in BigQuery where you want to upload the data.

Once I have those details, I can help modify the code for you!

>>> USER:
I have a simple feature data frame `sf_taiwan_county`. I want to upload to BigQuery

>>> ASSISTANT:
Great! To customize the code for uploading your `sf_taiwan_county` simple feature data frame to BigQuery, I'll need the following information:

1. **project_id**: Your Google Cloud project ID.
2. **dataset_id**: The dataset within BigQuery where you want to upload the data.
3. **table_name**: The name of the table in BigQuery where you want to upload the data.

Please provide these details, and I'll modify the code accordingly!

>>> USER:
project id is "my-first-project", dataset id is "data1", table name is "table_1"

>>> ASSISTANT:
Thank you for providing the details! Based on your inputs, here's the modified R code to upload the `sf_taiwan_county` simple feature data frame to BigQuery:

```r
# tidy up for big query
## 1. transform the CRS to 4326
sf_taiwan_county_4326 <- st_transform(sf_taiwan_county, crs = 4326)

## 2. convert geometry to WKT, and store it as a data frame
sf_taiwan_county_4326 %>%
    mutate(geometry = st_as_text(geometry)) |>
    as.data.frame() -> sf_taiwan_county_bq

## 3. create fields
fields <- sf_taiwan_county_bq |>
    select(-geometry) |>
    as_bq_fields()

fields <- bq_fields(
    list(
        fields,
        bq_field(name = "geometry", type = "GEOGRAPHY")
    )
)

## 4. obtain the data set from big query
project_id <- "my-first-project"  # Your project ID
dataset_id <- "data1"              # Your dataset ID

# get data set
ds <- bq_dataset(project_id, dataset_id)

## 5. upload the data to big query in a specific table with the fields
table_name <- "table_1"  # Your table name
bq_table_upload(
    x = bq_table(ds, table_name),
    values = sf_taiwan_county_bq,
    fields = fields,
    create_disposition = "CREATE_IF_NEEDED"
)
```

This code transforms the CRS of your `sf_taiwan_county` data frame to EPSG:4326, converts the geometry to WKT format, creates the necessary fields for BigQuery, and uploads the data to the specified dataset and table. 

Make sure to run it in an environment where you have the required libraries installed and properly configured to access Google BigQuery. If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask for help!

>>> USER:
Consider the following plot:
```
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg))
p2 <- p + geom_point()
```
Create shiny app where I can change point size with a slider UI

>>> ASSISTANT:
Certainly! Below is an example of a simple Shiny app where you can adjust the point size of a scatter plot using a slider.

### Shiny App Code

```r
# Load the shiny library
library(shiny)
library(ggplot2)

# Define the UI for the app
ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # Application title
  titlePanel("Point Size Adjuster"),
  
  # Sidebar layout with input and output definitions
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      # Slider input for point size
      sliderInput("point_size",
                  "Point Size:",
                  min = 1,
                  max = 10,
                  value = 3)  # Default point size
    ),
    
    # Show the plot in the main panel
    mainPanel(
      plotOutput("scatterPlot")
    )
  )
)

# Define server logic
server <- function(input, output) {
  
  # Generate the scatter plot based on the point size input
  output$scatterPlot <- renderPlot({
    # Create the ggplot with the specified point size from user input
    ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
      geom_point(size = input$point_size) +  # Adjust the point size
      labs(title = "Scatter Plot of MPG vs Weight",
           x = "Weight (1000 lbs)",
           y = "Miles per Gallon (MPG)")
  })
}

# Run the application 
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

### Instructions to Run the App

1. **Install Shiny and ggplot2**: Make sure you have the `shiny` and `ggplot2` packages installed. You can install them with:

   ```r
   install.packages("shiny")
   install.packages("ggplot2")
   ```

2. **Copy the Code**: Copy the provided code into a new R script or RMarkdown document.

3. **Run the App**: If you're using RStudio, you can click on the "Run App" button or simply run the following command in your R console:

   ```r
   shiny::runApp("path/to/your/script.R")
   ```

   Replace `"path/to/your/script.R"` with the actual path to your script if using an external file.

4. **Interact with the App**: A web browser window will open showing the app. You can adjust the point size using the slider, and the scatter plot will update in real-time based on your selection.

Feel free to modify the UI and server code to enhance the app or add more features!

>>> USER:
create a string vector of "Sheet1!Ax:Hy" format where x is 2, 7, 12, ..., 87, and y is 5, 10, ..., 90.

>>> ASSISTANT:
To create a string vector in R with the specified format of `"Sheet1!Ax:Hy"` where `x` values are in the sequence `2, 7, 12, ..., 87` and `y` values are in the sequence `5, 10, ..., 90`, you can follow these steps:

1. Generate the sequences for `x` and `y`.
2. Create the strings using `sprintf()` or `paste()`.

Here's how you can do it in R:

```r
# Generate the sequences for x and y
x_values <- seq(2, 87, 5)  # 2, 7, 12, ..., 87
y_values <- seq(5, 90, 5)   # 5, 10, ..., 90

# Create the string vector
result <- paste0("Sheet1!A", x_values, ":H", y_values)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

### Explanation:
- `seq(2, 87, 5)`: This generates the sequence from 2 to 87 with an increment of 5.
- `seq(5, 90, 5)`: This generates the sequence from 5 to 90 with an increment of 5.
- `paste0("Sheet1!A", x_values, ":H", y_values)`: This concatenates the strings to create the desired format.

### Result:
Running the above code will give you a string vector similar to:

```
[1] "Sheet1!A2:H5"   "Sheet1!A7:H10"  "Sheet1!A12:H15" "Sheet1!A17:H20" "Sheet1!A22:H25"
[6] "Sheet1!A27:H30" "Sheet1!A32:H35" "Sheet1!A37:H40" "Sheet1!A42:H45" "Sheet1!A47:H50"
[11] "Sheet1!A52:H55" "Sheet1!A57:H60" "Sheet1!A62:H65" "Sheet1!A67:H70" "Sheet1!A72:H75"
[16] "Sheet1!A77:H80" "Sheet1!A82:H85" "Sheet1!A87:H90"
```

This vector can be used as needed in your analysis or data manipulation tasks!

>>> USER:
read sheet from sheet names of `result` one by one and stored in a list.

>>> ASSISTANT:
To read sheets from a spreadsheet using R, you can use the `readxl` package, which allows you to read Excel files. Assuming you have an Excel file to read from where the sheet names correspond to the names generated in the `result` vector, you can do the following.

### Steps to Read Sheets into a List
1. Make sure you have the `readxl` package installed.
2. Use `lapply()` to iterate over each element of the `result` vector, reading the corresponding sheet into a list.

Here's a complete example:

```r
# Load the necessary library
library(readxl)

# Define your Excel file path (adjust the path to your actual file)
excel_file_path <- "path/to/your/excel/file.xlsx"

# Generate the result vector for sheet names (as previously defined)
x_values <- seq(2, 87, 5)  # sequence for x
y_values <- seq(5, 90, 5)   # sequence for y
result <- paste0("Sheet1!A", x_values, ":H", y_values)

# Read in the sheets into a list
# Initialize an empty list
data_list <- list()

# Loop through each sheet name in the result vector and read it
data_list <- lapply(result, function(sheet_name) {
  read_excel(excel_file_path, sheet = sheet_name)
})

# Optionally, if you want to name the list elements after the result names
names(data_list) <- result

# Print the structure of the list
str(data_list)
```

### Explanation:
- `library(readxl)`: Loads the `readxl` package necessary for reading Excel files.
- `excel_file_path`: You can replace this with the path to your Excel file.
- `lapply()`: This function iterates over `result`, which contains the sheet names, reads each sheet into a data frame using `read_excel()` and stores each data frame in a list.
- `names(data_list) <- result`: This assigns the corresponding sheet names as the names of each element in the list for easier identification.

### Note:
Make sure that the sheets you are trying to read actually exist in your Excel file, otherwise, you'll encounter errors. You can handle errors or check for the existence of sheets by adding some error handling in the above code. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
