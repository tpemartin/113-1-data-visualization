>>> ASSISTANT:
To visualize the given data in Google Looker similar to the attached graph, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Data:**
   - Ensure your data is structured with columns for "年度" (Year), "首站抵達地" (Arrival Region), and "總人數" (Total Population).
   - If your data spans multiple regions and years, organize it in a pivot table format.

2. **Create a New Looker Report:**
   - Open Google Looker and create a new report.

3. **Import Your Data:**
   - Connect to your data source (Google Sheets, BigQuery, etc.) and load your structured data into Looker.

4. **Configure the Visualization:**
   - In your report, select a line chart visualization.
   - Drag the "年度" (Year) field to the X-axis (horizontal axis).
   - Drag the "總人數" (Total Population) field to the Y-axis (vertical axis).
   - Add "首站抵達地" (Arrival Region) as a series or dimension to differentiate between regions with different colored lines.

5. **Customize the Chart:**
   - Adjust the chart settings to:
     - Change colors for each region for better distinction.
     - Add labels for the Y-axis (Total Population) and X-axis (Year).
     - Include a legend indicating which color corresponds to which region.
     - Set the title of the chart to something descriptive, like "Different Arrival Regions Over the Years".

6. **Fine-tune Visuals:**
   - Check grid lines, data point markers, and line styles to match your desired aesthetics as shown in the attached graph.
   - Ensure that the Y-axis scale fits your data correctly.

7. **Save and Share:**
   - Once satisfied with the visualization, save your report and share it with your stakeholders if necessary.

These steps should guide you to recreate a similar graph in Google Looker as shown in the attachment. Make sure to adjust any specific settings according to your preferences and data granularity.
