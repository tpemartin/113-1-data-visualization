Once you have your API key, invoke the registration function: `register_stadiamaps("YOUR-API-KEY", write = FALSE)`. Note that setting write = TRUE will update your ~/.Renviron file by replacing/adding the relevant line. If you use the former, know that youâ€™ll need to re-do it every time you reset R.
